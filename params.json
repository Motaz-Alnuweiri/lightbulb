{"name":"Lightbulb","tagline":"Open-source XMPP client for Symbian.","body":"### Welcome to Lightbulb\r\nLightbulb is an instant messenger for Symbian based on [MeegIM](https://projects.developer.nokia.com/meegim) and licensed on GPL 3 license. It is written using Symbian C++, Qt and QtQuick. Also uses qxmpp library for XMPP support.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* sending, receiving messages\r\n* lots of customization options\r\n* notifications (info banner in app, discreet popup, notification led, vibration, and sound)\r\n* partial multi account support (you can add multiple ones, but only one can be enabled)\r\n* roster management\r\n* VCard, avatars and stuff\r\n* typing notifications\r\n* ... and more! (I love how this one sounds :D)\r\n\r\n### Why would I need this anyway?\r\nLightbulb IM can be used for Google Talk/Hangouts, Facebook Chat and is compatible with probably any XMPP server. It's beautiful and should handle your text messages correctly. Wanna use it for something else than XMPP? You should familiarize yourself with transports. I use it for Gadu-Gadu myself. :)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCore developer of this software is @ksiazkowicz. This piece of code reuses some bits and pieces from Tweetian app by @dicksonleong and was coded with some very useful help and support from @huellif (we actually had to go through some undocummented Symbian APIs). \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Change status dialog](http://i.imgur.com/upN00fHm.jpg) ![Roster](http://i.imgur.com/RN4LNWmm.jpg) ![First run wizard](http://i.imgur.com/m9te8iFm.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Where to get it?\r\nYou can get latest releases from my GitHub, [here](https://github.com/ksiazkowicz/lightbulb/releases) or from [Symbian Store](http://symbianstore.symbian-developers.net).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
